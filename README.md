C8 is a CHIP-8 interpreter and virtual machine written in Java.
Tested on both Linux and Windows, included ROMs are not written by me but were released into the public domain.

How to use: run "java -jar c8.jar [enter ROM location]" from the command line

Example:
java -jar build/c8.jar roms/pong2
^ This will allow you to play Pong2

Controls:
16 key keypad:
1234
QWER
ASDF
ZXCV

All games use different controls.
